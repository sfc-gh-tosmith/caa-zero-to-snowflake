This repository holds the code used in Zero to Snowflake Hands-on Labs delivered by Snowflake Customer Adoption Associates starting Summer 2025. 

## How is the code organized?
The code for this repository is split into the Admin and Analyst sections. 

### Admin
The admin code helps demonstrate some of the management aspects of Snowflake, including:
- Creating compute instances
- Managing users and roles
- Exploring and controlling costs
- Examining your account's security posture

### Analyst
This code is centered around an Analyst persona, covering the following:
- Snowflake UI
- Object Heirarchy
- Querying data
- Switching roles
