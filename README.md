# CAA Zero to Snowflake 2025

This repository holds the code used in Zero to Snowflake Hands-on Labs delivered by Snowflake Customer Adoption Associates starting Summer 2025. 

## How is the code organized?
The code for this repository is split into the Admin and Analyst sections. 

### Admin
The admin code helps demonstrate some of the management aspects of Snowflake, including:
- Creating compute instances
- Managing users and roles
- Exploring and controlling costs
- Examining your account's security posture

### Analyst
This code is centered around an Analyst persona, covering the following:
- Snowflake UI
- Object Heirarchy
- Querying data
- Switching roles

## How to Run
Copy and paste the SQL code into your Snowflake environment, then walk through it step by step. Your permissions may be insufficient for some parts of the lab; please reach out to your account administrator if that is the case.
