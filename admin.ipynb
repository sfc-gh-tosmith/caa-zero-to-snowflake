    "1. Results Cache: Whenever Snowflake executes a SELECT query, the results returned to the end-user are stored and immediately returned by subsequent queries . While this may seem pointless, it significantly affects query performance, primarily when queries run from dashboards or business intelligence applications where the query text is unchanged. This means (for example) that when a complex query is executed, which can take minutes to complete, subsequent executions return results within milliseconds. Like other Snowflake features, this cache is managed automatically and is cleared whenever the underlying data changes, so users are always given a correct, consistent result. One of the benefits of fetching data from the results cache is that the executing query doesn't need a virtual warehouse. In addition to improving query performance, this can also reduce costs.\n",
